Welcome to the bloco.exchange SDK repository! This SDK is currently under active development and will be released soon. It aims to provide a powerful and intuitive framework for building intelligent, modular applications on the bloco.exchange platform.

## Overview

The bloco.exchange SDK is designed to simplify the development of autonomous assistants by offering a set of tools, libraries, and APIs. It enables developers to create complex applications by leveraging the power of modular components called Modules.

## Features (Planned)

- Easy integration with various APIs and external services
- Modular architecture for building reusable and composable components
- Intuitive API for creating and managing Assistants
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Seamless deployment and integration with the bloco.exchange platform
- Active community support and resources

## Getting Started
